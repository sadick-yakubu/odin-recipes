  <P><h3>Ingredients:</h3></P>
  <ul>
   <li>1 teaspoon of peeled, fresh grated ginger (about an inch to 1 1/2 inch)</li>
   <li>2–3 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground aniseed (<em>sekoni</em>) or other seasoning of your choice</li>
   <li>1 heaping teaspoon of no-salt seasoning of your choice (I’m using Mrs. Dash garlic and herb; many Ghanaians would likely use a couple of seasoning cubes)</li>
   <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground dried red chili pepper</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste, or substitute seasoning salt)</li>
   <li>2 small bay leaves</li>
   <li>1/2 cup onion, chopped</li>
   <li>3 whole kpakpo shito, whole, if available and (if not, substitute your choice of pepper(s), top(s) sliced off (about a tablespoon), or omit altogether</li>
  </ul>
  <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
  <ol>
   <li>Put the goat meat in a soup pot and season it with the above ingredients. Stir the goat meat well, and add 1/2 cup water to the pot. Cover, bring the water to a boil, lower the heat to simmer while you prepare a second pot with:</li>
   <ul>
    <li>4 oz of washed tomatoes, whole (1 large or 2 small-to-medium. I used 4 small Campari)</li>
    <li>4 oz of peeled onion (about 1 medium)</li>
    <li>Fresh whole red chilli peppers to taste (probably 1 to 3, depending on type and heat), tops cut off, and seeded if you like</li>
    <li>4 cups of water</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Bring that water to a boil and simmer 10 or 15 minutes until the vegetables are soft, then remove grind them together (in a blender or anasanka) and return them to the water in the second pot, along with 4 more cups of water.</li>
   <li>Stir in 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, let it simmer a few minutes, and add the broth to the meat. Let the soup simmer until the goat meat is tender, then remove the goat meat and, for a nice clear soup, strain the broth through a sieve, into the using a spoon if necessary to help force some of the ground vegetables through the sieve (scrape the underside of the strainer with a spoon).</li>
   <li>Return the meat to the pot and adjust the seasonings (salt, onion, tomato, pepper, etc.) to taste. This may need to simmer for a couple of hours: goat meat tends to be tougher than beef. Add a little more water if necessary.</li>
  </ol>
